        I started tutoring math and english during my first semester in College
        at Los Angeles Pierce College. When studying I always found it helpful
        to imagine explaining the material to someone else. When I actually was
        explaining topics to other people, it came easy from all the imaginary
        practice. After a few college courses in Computer Science, the head of
        the department approacched me and asked if I had any interest in being
        an embedded tutor for introductory programming classes. The position was
        similar to a TA. I immediately accepted. I tutored classes and privately
        until I transeferred schools in 2019. In the fall of 2018 the computer
        science department introduced an award for outstanding students, I was
        one three awared with the accolade. As much as I wish I could say it was
        for my quality as a student (I was an A student, but nothing incredibly
        impressive), I was told that it was because of the kind things my
        students said about me and my tutoring. I continue to tutor and I never
        fail to enjoy it.
